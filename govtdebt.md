# Original Data Source

This chart represents the original data source that was used to create my Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio visualizations.

# Additional Flourish Visualizations

For my first visualization, I created a grid of line charts that depicts the Debt-to-GDP Ratio for countries for which the OECD published data. To improve upon this design, I also created a grid of stacked area charts that provides the viewer with a stronger sense of volume when comparing Debt-to-GDP Ratio across countries. Adding the additional element of volume to the grid of stacked area charts makes it easier for the viewer to identify at any point which countries have consistently high debt versus low debt.
