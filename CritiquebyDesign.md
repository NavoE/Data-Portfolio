*Selecting a visualization to redesign*

I chose the [Second Cities: Keeping Pace with a Booming New York](https://www.census.gov/dataviz/visualizations/036/) visualization because of my background in urban planning. I felt that there was a lot to learn from seeing the population trends of major U.S. cities over time in terms of how urban development might have played a part in population increases.

*Wireframing a solution*

I chose to approache my redesign by focusing primarily on simplifying the visual.
