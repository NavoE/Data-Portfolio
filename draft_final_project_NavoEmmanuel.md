Further building upon [last week's final project outline](/final_project_NavoEmmanuel.md), I have [created a draft of my project using Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/xv0u6RTv54IaORB6) and conducted three interviews to test the efficacy of my project. The audience that I aim to persuade is a politically-oriented one that has the ability to contribute to [Prosperity Now's Racial Wealth Divide Initiative & Projects](https://prosperitynow.org/racial-wealth-divide-initiative). Since my ideal audience is very specific to a particular niche, I chose my interviewees based on how politically involved they are. During the interviews, I used the user research protocol below. Based on the responses that I received, I aim to add more metrics and dig deeper into the narrative by framing the path of a child from childhood to adulthood and illustrating their experiences based on data. 

**Goals**

Evaluate the efficacy of my call-to-action
Determine how my story can be improved upon

**Script**

“My goal today is to get feedback on a new page I'm designing. I’m talking to people to see what makes sense and what’s confusing. All feedback is anonymous, and the test should take less than 10 minutes of your time.”

“Please remember when I say ‘test’ I mean I’m testing my website and if it is clear or not. There are no wrong answers for you!”

"Imagine somebody sent you a link to this site and this is what popped up in front of you when you clicked on the link. If you could, please share with me anything (word, phrase, section, prompt) that you find confusing. Also share anything that makes sense to you and that you'd like more information about. Finally, let me know if there is anything you're not interested in/want to see less of."
