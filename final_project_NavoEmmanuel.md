# Project Summary
For my project, I aim to tell the story of America's Poverty Trap pipeline. I will do so by illustrating parallel paths of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, & People of Color) and non-BIPOC invididuals using census data. The goal is to show the progression of outcomes by age cohort of educational, income, and additional socio-economic indicator variables.

# Project Structure
*Introduction*

*Background on Disparaties*
This section will include research on historical disparaty trends and how they've impacted the outcomes of both BIPOC and non-BIPOC individuals.

*Life-arc of BIPOC vs non-BIPOC individuals*
I will leverage census data to creagte a hollistic story arc of the two demographic groups that I'm aiming to compare.

*Advocacy Opportunities*
I will provide resources to advocacy organizations that are actively disrupting the Pipeline to Poverty cycle.

# Data Plan
I plan to collect my data from the [Census Bureau's database](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). This data will represent the average outcome of each demographic group of interest across various demographic features that reflect socioeconomic outcomes.

# Shorthand
I plan to use Shorthand to publish my project.
