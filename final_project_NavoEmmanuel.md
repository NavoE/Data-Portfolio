# Project Summary
For my project, I aim to tell the story of America's Poverty Trap pipeline. I will do so by illustrating parallel paths of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, & People of Color) and non-BIPOC invididuals using census data. The goal is to show the progression of outcomes by age cohort of educational, income, and additional socio-economic indicator variables.
