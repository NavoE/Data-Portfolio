# Data-Portfolio
This is my Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU

# About Me
I am a mission-driven creative and social advocate who uses my analytical skills to demonstrate cases for equitable socio-economic solutions. My work involves using urban planning and advanced statistical knowledge to support the process of translating data into captivating stories and impactful insights. My background as a Mende refugee of Sierra Leone and first-hand experiences working in both developing and developed landscapes fuel my drive to support the capacity building tactics that most exemplify the human journey. With my free time, I indulge in the arts and spend time contemplating how to make the world a better place for all, one idea at a time.

I’ve also been featured sharing my journey in an Emmy Winning Spectrum News Documentary. Let’s collaborate!
